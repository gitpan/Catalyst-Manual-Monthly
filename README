Catalyst-Manual-Monthly

This is repository for the monthly articles which replace the Catalyst
Advent Calendar.  Following the Catalyst philosophy, the Catalyst monthly
doesn't use Catalyst it uses the CPAN toolchain to achieve its aims.
Occasionally a catalyst application (e.g. Metacpan) might be used for
system integration tasks.

Articles are stored in directories as with:
lib/Catalyst/Monthly/[Year]/[Month]/[SomeDescriptiveFilename].pod

In due course an RSS scraper will be written to facilitate notifications of
publication of new articles and edits to old articles.
